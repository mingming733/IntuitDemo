The objective of this project is to build a web based single-page-application user-interface
to display documents organized by tags in folder like structure. 
Assume document is an email message for purpose of building the demo.

** Background

Our repository consists of Documents which are "tagged."  Documents
themselves are immutable, that is, unchanging.  Think of an e-mail
message: the content of that message never changes.

Each document is associated with a set of strings: these strings are
called "tags."  Example tags in our system is "unread": if a document
has the string "unread" in its tag-set, then the document has never
been read by the user.  A document can be associated with multiple tags.


Define REST resource based API interface to access documents and associated tags.
Mock the data for various resource operations.

Build an user interface with following functionality.
- Displays all available unique tags (simlar to an email client displaying folders).
- Upon click of a tags displays all documents matching the selected tag.
- Upon selecting a document, displays the contents.
- Though the applications is SPA, application should facilitate the bookmarkable URL for given tag or document.
- All interactions with the backend should be via a REST API.

** Submission Guidelines
- Checkin working code into your own publically accessilble git repository and provide the link.
    - Create a readme describing the outlilne of approach and additional assumptions made.
    - Provide steps to deploy and view the SPA app.
    - Create a list of known issues (if any) in git.
- Make sure there is enough sample data to demo the full functionality.
- Please go ahead and make assumptions regarding anything that is not explicitly mentioned. Be sure to conspicuously bring out and state such assumptions
- Do consider code hygiene and technical excellence aspects. Unit tests and their quality will carry weightage
